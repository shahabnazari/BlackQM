## 🔄 DATA FLOW ARCHITECTURE

### Before Phase 9.5 (BROKEN):
```
Phase 9: Literature Review
  → Papers, themes, gaps discovered
  ↓ [CRITICAL GAP - NO SYSTEMATIC DESIGN]
Phase 10: Statement Generation
  → Statements created (not informed by research questions)
```

### After Phase 9.5 (COMPLETE):
```
Phase 9: Literature Review (DISCOVER)
  ↓ Papers + Themes + Gaps + Contradictions
Phase 9.5: Research Design Intelligence (DESIGN)
  ↓ Questions (SQUARE-IT scored) + Sub-Questions + Hypotheses + Theory
Phase 10: Statement Generation (BUILD)
  ↓ Statements (informed by questions/hypotheses/theory)
```

### Complete Provenance Chain:
```
Paper → Gap → Question → Sub-Question → Hypothesis → Statement → Factor → Insight
```

## 💡 REVOLUTIONARY FEATURES

### 1. SQUARE-IT Framework (2025 Innovation)
**What it is:** Latest academic framework for evaluating research questions
- **S**pecific: Narrow broad questions using themes
- **Q**uantifiable: Identify measurable variables
- **U**sable: Assess contribution potential
- **A**ccurate: Precise problem definition
- **R**estricted: Focus by domain/method/population
- **E**ligible: Q-methodology suitability
- **I**nvestigable: Feasibility scoring
- **T**imely: Check if gap still exists

**Why revolutionary:** FIRST automated implementation (no competitor has this)

### 2. Multi-Source Hypothesis Generator
**From contradictions:**
- Analyzes conflicting findings across papers + videos + social media
- Generates competing hypotheses with evidence
- Example: "Paper A found X in population 1, Paper B found Y in population 2 → H1: Effect varies by population characteristics"

**From gaps:**
- Identifies unexplored relationships in literature
- Generates exploratory hypotheses
- Example: "No research on X × Y → H1: X positively correlates with Y"

**From trends:**
- Detects emerging patterns across sources
- Generates predictive hypotheses
- Example: "Trend: X increasing 15% annually → H1: X will exceed threshold by 2027"

**Why revolutionary:** FIRST tool to generate hypotheses from multi-source evidence

### 3. Sub-Question Decomposition
**What it does:**
- Takes broad research question
- Breaks into 3-5 testable sub-questions
- Maps each to specific literature gaps
- Prioritizes by: Feasibility × Impact × Novelty

**Example:**
```
Main Question: "How does social media affect mental health?"
  ↓ [AI decomposition]
Sub-Q1: "What is the relationship between daily social media use and anxiety?" (Gap #3, Feasibility: High)
Sub-Q2: "How does FOMO mediate the social media-depression link?" (Gap #7, Impact: High)
Sub-Q3: "Do age groups differ in vulnerability to social media effects?" (Gap #12, Novelty: Medium)
```

**Why revolutionary:** FIRST automated sub-question generation with gap mapping

### 4. Theory Development Assistant
**What it does:**
- Extracts constructs from knowledge graph
- Identifies relationships from papers
- Generates visual theory diagram
- Suggests mediators/moderators
- Creates conceptual framework

**Why revolutionary:** Automates what typically takes researchers weeks

### 5. Q-Methodology Optimizer
**What it does:**
- Analyzes research question complexity
- Recommends statement count (30-60)
- Suggests P-set size from literature themes
- Estimates factor count from topic models
- Provides timeline and resource estimates

**Why revolutionary:** FIRST tool with Q-method-specific optimization
