## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

### For New Developers:
1. **START HERE:** Read `REPOSITORY_STANDARDS.md` first (mandatory)
2. **THEN:** Open `IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md` to see current progress
3. **REFERENCE:** Use Guide Part1 or Part2 based on which phase you're working on

### Current Priority (Phase 6):
```bash
# You're working on Phase 6: Q-Analytics Completeness
# Reference these sections:
- IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_PRIORITY.md → Week 1 Sprint Plan
- IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES_ENHANCED.md → Phase 6 detailed specs
- Development_Implementation_Guide_Part2_ENHANCED.md → Q-Analysis implementation
- Focus: PQMethod-compatible analysis engine with interactive UI
```

### Document Relationships:
```
IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md (WHEN/Checklist)
    ├── References → Guide Part1 (HOW for Phases 1-3)
    ├── References → Guide Part2 (HOW for Phases 4-7)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always check file location:** Use REPOSITORY_STANDARDS.md before creating files
2. **Track your progress:** Update checkboxes in IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md as you complete tasks
3. **Test at checkpoints:** Don't skip the 🔍 testing sections in the phases
4. **Use safe startup:** Run `npm run dev:safe` to avoid port conflicts
5. **Reference the guides:** Technical details are in the Implementation Guides, not the phases doc
