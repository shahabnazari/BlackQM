- Phase 3: Dual Interface Architecture
- Phase 3.5: Critical Infrastructure & Testing
- Phase 4: Data Visualization & Analytics
- Phase 5: Professional Polish & Delight
- Phase 5.5: Critical UI & User Experience
- Phase 6: Q-Analytics Engine (including 6.5 and 6.6)

### 📁 [IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES_PART2.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES_PART2.md)

**Enterprise & Advanced Features (Phases 7-12)**

- Phase 7: Advanced Security & Compliance
- Phase 8: Observability & SRE Excellence
- Phase 9: Performance & Scale Optimization
- Phase 10: Quality Gates & Testing Excellence
- Phase 11: Internationalization & Accessibility
- Phase 12: Growth & Monetization
