## Q-Methodology Core Implementation

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Before implementing ANY code, you MUST read [REPOSITORY_STANDARDS.md](./REPOSITORY_STANDARDS.md) for mandatory file organization rules. Violations will block commits.

**Document Coverage:** This part serves as a bridge document focusing on Q-methodology specific implementation details, connecting development procedures (Part 2) with security & excellence features (Part 4).

**Phase Mapping:**
- **Phase 3:** Q-Methodology Core → Backend implementation details
- **Phase 6:** Q-Analytics Engine → Advanced analysis features
- **Phase 6.8:** Study Creation Excellence → Rich editing and templates (See PHASE_6.8_STUDY_CREATION_EXCELLENCE.md)

**Version:** 3.2 (Created for document reorganization)  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Document Type:** Technical Bridge Document  
**Build Approach:** Q-methodology expertise with research best practices
