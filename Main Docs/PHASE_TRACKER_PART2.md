### Service Dependencies Map (Prevent Circular Dependencies):
- literature.service depends on theme-extraction.service
- statement-generator.service depends on literature themes and bias-detector.service
- study.service depends on analysis.service, which depends on report.service
- archive.service depends on analysis.service
- See Implementation Guide Part 5 for detailed service dependency architecture

### Testing Strategy to Catch Issues Early:
1. **Integration Tests First** - Test service connections before UI
2. **Data Flow Tests** - Verify data persists between phases
3. **Foreign Key Tests** - Ensure relationships work
4. **Mock Data Detection** - Tests fail if hardcoded data returned

**Lifecycle Phase:** DISCOVER + PIPELINE - Complete Research Intelligence with Data Flow (85% Coverage)
**Patent Potential:** 🔥 EXCEPTIONAL - 7+ novel innovations including Knowledge Graph & Predictive Gaps

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Days 7-11 Must Come Before Advanced Features
**Why:** Pipeline infrastructure (foreign keys, theme extraction fix, service wiring) must exist before building knowledge graphs or social media integration

### 📝 ENTITY NAMING DECISION (Architectural Choice)
**Database Model:** `Survey` - Used consistently in Prisma schema, API endpoints, and backend services
**User-Facing Label:** `Study` - Displayed in UI for better academic familiarity
**Rationale:** Survey is technically accurate for Q-methodology, but Study resonates better with researchers. This dual-naming approach maintains code consistency while optimizing UX.

### Day 3.12: CRITICAL PIPELINE DISCONNECTION DISCOVERED (Sept 26, 2025) ✅ DOCUMENTED
**Issue:** Literature Review → Study Creation Pipeline is COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED

#### 🔴 CRITICAL FINDINGS:
- [x] **No Foreign Keys:** Survey model has NO reference to Papers, ResearchGaps, or PaperThemes
- [x] **Hardcoded Returns:** theme-extraction.service.ts returns SAME themes regardless of input
- [x] **studyContext Unused:** Parameter exists in 3 services but never persisted to database
- [x] **Missing Models:** No Study model (only Survey), no Publication, no ResearchPipeline
- [x] **Isolated Services:** Each phase operates independently with no data flow

#### What Was Planned But Never Built:
- studyContext object with topic, researchQuestions, targetAudience
- Appears in 3 files but is NEVER SAVED to database

#### Services That Exist But Don't Connect:
- ✅ StatementGeneratorService - exists but no literature input
- ✅ MethodologyService - exists but no connection to gaps
- ✅ OpenAIService - exists but not integrated with themes
- ✅ Paper, PaperTheme, ResearchGap models - exist but isolated

#### The Envisioned Pipeline That Doesn't Exist:
Complete pipeline flow: Literature Review → Extract Themes → Generate Statements → Create Study → Analyze → Report
All steps marked incomplete (Day 8-11 addresses this gap)

**IMPACT:** Users cannot leverage literature insights for study creation. Each phase starts from scratch.

#### 📋 TASK 4: Enhanced Statement Generation with Multimedia Provenance

**Extend Existing StatementGeneratorService:**
- File: `backend/src/modules/ai/services/statement-generator.service.ts`
- EXTENDS existing service from Phase 6.86b (DO NOT DUPLICATE)

**New Method to Add:**
- `generateStatementsFromMultiPlatform(themes, studyContext)` - Generate statements from mixed sources

**Multimedia Provenance Tracking:**

**1. Source Type Categorization:**
- Traditional papers
- YouTube videos (with video ID + timestamp)
- Podcasts (with episode URL + timestamp)
- Social media (TikTok/Instagram with video ID + timestamp)

**2. Confidence Scoring Algorithm:**
Confidence weights by source type:
- Papers: **1.0** (highest confidence)
- Academic YouTube: **0.7** (research talks, lectures)
- Research podcasts: **0.6** (expert interviews, academic discussions)
- TikTok/Instagram: **0.3** (lower confidence, popular content)

**Calculation:** Average weighted confidence across all sources for statement
**Example:** Statement from 2 papers + 1 YouTube video = (1.0 + 1.0 + 0.7) / 3 = 0.9 confidence

**3. Timestamp Extraction:**
- For each multimedia source, extract exact timestamp where statement theme appears
- Store: `{platform: 'youtube', videoId: 'abc123', timestamp: 145, url: 'youtube.com/watch?v=abc123&t=145'}`
- Frontend shows clickable timestamp links

**Frontend Statement Card Updates:**
- File: `frontend/components/statements/StatementCard.tsx`

**New UI Elements:**
- **Source Count Badges**: Papers (3), Videos (2), Podcasts (1), Social Media (0)
- **Timestamp Links**: Clickable links to exact moment in video/podcast
  - Example: "YouTube @ 2:25", "Podcast @ 15:30"
  - Click opens video at exact timestamp
- **Confidence Score Indicator**: Visual indicator (green = high, yellow = medium, red = low)
  - High (>0.8): Multiple papers + some multimedia
  - Medium (0.5-0.8): Mix of papers and multimedia
  - Low (<0.5): Mostly social media sources

**Technical Reference:** See IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_PART5.md - Day 19, Task 4 for implementation

**Checklist:**
- [x] **9:00 AM:** Extend StatementGeneratorService with multimedia support (187 lines added)
- [x] **10:00 AM:** Implement confidence scoring algorithm (Paper: 1.0, YouTube: 0.7, Podcast: 0.6, Social: 0.3)
- [x] **11:00 AM:** Add timestamp extraction with clickable URLs
- [x] **12:00 PM:** Add StatementWithProvenance interface & MultimediaSource interface

### Day 20.5: Critical UX Clarity & Integration Fixes 🔧
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (October 4, 2025)
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Fixes broken user experience
**Dependencies:** Day 20 complete ✅
**Duration:** 4 hours
**Date Added:** October 3, 2025
**Completion:** All 4 tasks complete, TypeScript errors: 99 (well below 587 threshold), Security audit: ✅ Passed

#### 🎯 PROBLEM STATEMENT

**Day 20 Backend Issues:**
- ✅ Backend: UnifiedThemeExtractionService 100% complete (1,120 lines)
- ✅ Components: ThemeCard + ThemeProvenancePanel complete (700+ lines)
- ❌ **UI Integration:** Broken - video themes disappear, transcriptions invisible

**User-Reported Issues:**
1. ❌ "Where do video transcriptions go?" - Not visible anywhere
2. ❌ "Two different theme extraction controls?" - Confusing UX
3. ❌ "Thought they were unified in Day 20?" - Backend unified, UI fragmented

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Day 20 unified the BACKEND architecture ✅
- Day 20 created UI COMPONENTS ✅
- Day 20 DID NOT connect multimedia workflow to UI ❌

**Critical Gap:**
- Current: Papers successfully route to Themes tab; Videos disappear after transcription
- Expected: Both Papers and Videos route to unified Themes tab with clear provenance
- Solution: Unified extraction button and dedicated Transcriptions tab for visibility

---

#### 📋 TASK 1: Create Transcriptions Tab (2 hours)

**Problem:** Users transcribe videos but results are invisible
**Solution:** Dedicated tab showing all transcriptions

**New UI Section:**
- Add "Transcriptions" tab to main TabsList
- Position: between Search and Themes tabs
- Displays all transcribed videos with full details
- See Implementation Guide Part 5 for tab structure

**Transcriptions Tab Features:**
- [x] List all transcribed videos with metadata
- [x] Show full transcript text (expandable/collapsible)
- [x] Display extracted themes (if available)
- [x] Show cost paid per video
- [x] Duration & publish date
- [x] Clickable YouTube link
- [x] Status indicators:
  - 🔵 Transcribing... (with progress)
  - 🟢 Complete ($0.18)
  - 🟣 Cached ($0.00 - already paid)
- [x] "Add to Unified Themes" button per video
- [x] Batch select for unified extraction (via unified button)

**Frontend State:**
- [x] State: transcribedVideos array stores all transcribed content
- [x] Interface includes: id, title, sourceId (YouTube video ID), transcript, duration, cost
- [x] Optional themes if extracted
- [x] Timestamped text segments for navigation

**Backend Integration:**
- [x] Update `searchAlternativeSources()` to return transcripts (already implemented in Day 18)
- [x] Add `transcriptionOptions` parameter to API call (already implemented)
- [x] Return: `{ videos: [...], transcripts: [...] }` (frontend receives and stores)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Users see all transcribed videos
- ✅ Transcripts are readable
- ✅ Cost is clearly shown
- ✅ Can identify cached videos ($0.00)

---

#### 📋 TASK 2: Unify Theme Extraction UI (1 hour)

**Problem:** Two separate "extract themes" controls confuse users
**Solution:** Single unified button for ALL sources

**Current Fragmentation:**

- YouTube panel has separate "Extract themes" checkbox for videos only
- Creates user confusion about which control to use

**Unified Solution:**
- Single "Extract Themes from Selected Sources" button
- Displays count of selected papers and videos
- Works on all source types simultaneously

**Implementation:**
- [x] REMOVE: YouTube panel checkbox (Line 1028-1050 removed)
- [x] UPDATE: Top "Extract Themes" button to handle ALL sources
- [x] ADD: Source count badges on button (shows papers + videos separately)
- [x] INTEGRATE: Video transcripts into unified extraction

**Updated handleExtractThemes:**

### 🎯 INNOVATION RATIONALE

**The Critical Gap:**
Currently researchers jump from DISCOVER (literature review) directly to BUILD (statement creation) with NO systematic question/hypothesis development. This is scientifically unsound.

**Standard Research Process:**
1. Literature review → identify gaps ✅ (Phase 9)
2. **Refine research questions from gaps** ❌ (MISSING)
3. **Develop hypotheses from contradictions** ❌ (MISSING)
4. Design methodology ⏳ (Partial in study creation)
5. Create instruments (statements) ✅ (Phase 10)

**What Competitors Don't Have:**
- Elicit: Only paper search + basic brainstorming
- Consensus: Only answer extraction
- SciSpace: Only literature search
- AnswerThis: Only gap identification
- **NO TOOL** does systematic question refinement + hypothesis generation + theory building

### 🔧 Outstanding Issues from Phase 9 (To Address in Days 2-3)

**Critical Issues Requiring Attention:**

#### Theme Extraction Dependencies
- [ ] **Issue:** Theme extraction endpoints return empty results
  - **Root Cause:** Endpoints expect papers to be saved in database before extraction
  - **Impact:** Users cannot extract themes from search results directly
  - **Solution Options:**
    1. Use `/api/literature/themes/unified-extract` (works without saving papers)
    2. Implement auto-save of papers before extraction
    3. Add frontend guidance to save papers first
  - **Documentation:** THEME_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md created
  - **Priority:** Medium (workaround exists with unified endpoint)
  - **Suggested Fix:** Add to Day 2 or Day 3 frontend work

#### Login & Authentication
- [x] **Issue:** Test account credentials need documentation
  - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - TEST_ACCOUNTS.md created with working credentials
  - **Test Accounts Available:**
    - researcher@test.com / password123
    - test@example.com / Test123456
    - admin@vqmethod.com / Admin123456

#### TypeScript Compilation
- [ ] **Current Status:** 13 TypeScript errors remaining (down from 60)
  - **Breakdown:** Test configs (2), utility files (6), sample data (5)
  - **Impact:** Non-blocking - main app compiles successfully
  - **Location:** playwright.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, feature-flags.tsx, sample-data.ts
  - **Priority:** Low (website fully functional)
  - **Note:** All critical app errors (47) have been fixed
  - **Suggested Fix:** Optional cleanup task for Day 3 evening

#### OpenAI API Configuration
- [ ] **Issue:** Theme extraction returns 0 themes (AI not extracting)
  - **Root Cause:** OPENAI_API_KEY may not be configured in backend .env
  - **Impact:** Theme extraction endpoint works but returns empty themes array
  - **Solution:** Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set in backend/.env
  - **Priority:** High (affects core feature)
  - **Suggested Fix:** Verify before Day 2 AI work begins
