## 📝 Documentation Format

When coding innovative features, add comments like:

```typescript
// Innovative approach: Literature to Statement Generation
// This algorithm is unique because:
// 1. Extracts themes using NLP clustering
// 2. Identifies controversies from citation patterns
// 3. Generates balanced statement pairs
// Performance: Processes 100 papers in <5 seconds
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

### Now → Phase 8.5 (2 weeks)
- Complete current phases
- Start Phase 8.5 Navigation

### Weeks 3-4 → Phase 9
- Build literature review system
- **Document innovations as you code**

### Week 5 → Phase 10
- Build report generation
- **Document AI writer algorithm**

### Week 6 → Phase 11
- Build archive system
- **Document version control**

### Later → Phase 13 (Day 1)
- Review all documentation
- Compile technical specs
- **Decide if/when to file patents**

## 💡 Why This Works

1. **No Development Delay:** Patents don't slow you down
2. **Better Documentation:** Working code = clearer patents
3. **Flexibility:** Can decide later what to patent
4. **Cost Efficient:** No upfront patent costs
5. **Investor Ready:** Can show "patent-pending" when needed

## ✅ What You Need to Do

### As You Code:
- Write clear comments for unique algorithms
- Note performance metrics
- Save complex algorithms to `/docs/technical/`
- Think about what makes each feature special

### In Phase 13:
- Review all documentation
- Compile innovative features list
- Create technical diagrams if needed
- Consult patent attorney if funding available

### Patent Filing (When Ready):
- Can file provisional patents ($70-140 each)
- Have 12 months to file full patents
- Can show "patent pending" to investors
- Or keep as trade secrets

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **No new patent documents needed** - Everything lives in Phase Tracker + Implementation Guide
- **Documentation is optional** - Only document if truly innovative
- **Filing is deferred** - Focus on building great features first
- **Keep it simple** - Don't overcomplicate the development process
