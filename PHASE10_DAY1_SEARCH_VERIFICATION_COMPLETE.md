- Correctly identifies critical/unique terms
- Penalizes papers without critical terms (90% score reduction)
- Allows generic queries to work normally

### 3. Relevance Scoring ✅

- Papers with query terms in **title** score highest
- Papers with multiple term matches rank higher
- Score distribution is logical and predictable

### 4. Filter Balance ✅

- Strict enough to filter out irrelevant papers
- Flexible enough to show results (no "0 results" errors)
- Graceful degradation when few results available
